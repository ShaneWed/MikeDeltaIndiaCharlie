# MikeDeltaIndiaCharlie - A Multi-Layer Perceptron
* Multi-layer perceptron that currently implements the xor and sin functions with 
great or perfect accuracy.
* Can utilize sigmoid or tanh activation functions 
and receive variable inputs to give variable outputs.
* Currently refining this project to implement further functionality.
* Need to add the letter classification and make the MLP file more test case agnostic.
